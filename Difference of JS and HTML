HTML is like the blueprint or the plan for your sandcastle. It tells you where to put the walls, the towers, and the moat. You use it to create the structure of your sandcastle. So, when you're making a webpage, HTML helps you create the layout, the headings, paragraphs, images, and links â€“ all the parts that make up the webpage.
JavaScript, on the other hand, is like the magic wand you use to make your sandcastle do cool things. It's like adding special powers to your sandcastle blueprint. With JavaScript, you can make parts of your webpage move, change colors, and even talk to other parts of the webpage. It adds interactivity and makes your webpage more lively, just like if your sandcastle could suddenly start dancing or changing shape when you want it to!
So, HTML builds the structure of the webpage, while JavaScript adds the fun and interactive stuff to make it more exciting. Just like how you need both the sandcastle design and the magic wand to make an awesome sandcastle on the beach!
